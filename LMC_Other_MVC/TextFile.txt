/*
'WHERE inv.InsertDate >= DATEADD(D, -30, inv.InsertDate)'
This line is a condition that filters the rows from the InventoryData table based on a specific condition involving the InsertDate column.

DATEADD(D, -30, inv.InsertDate): This is a function that adds a specified number of days (in this case, -30 days) to the InsertDate. The DATEADD function is used here to calculate a date that is 30 days before each InsertDate.

WHERE inv.InsertDate >= DATEADD(D, -30, inv.InsertDate): This condition filters the rows where the InsertDate is greater than or equal to the date that is 30 days before the InsertDate. In other words, it selects rows where the InsertDate is within the last 30 days.

So, this line is ensuring that only rows with an InsertDate within the last 30 days are included in the result set. It's a way to focus on recent data in your query.

I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to intern with Belgioioso Cheese over the past three months. The experience has been invaluable, and I appreciate the chance to gain real-world exposure in a professional setting.

While I am grateful for the opportunity, I wanted to share some feedback on my internship experience. I understand that the company may not have a formalized internship plan, and I recognize that I initiated this opportunity. However, I believe that having a more structured plan or mentorship system in place could enhance the overall learning experience for future interns.

I found the experience beneficial, but I believe a more defined structure could help interns like me maximize their contributions and learning. Perhaps a clear outline of expectations, regular check-ins, or assigned projects could provide a more enriching experience for future interns.

Once again, thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge I've gained in my future endeavors. I appreciate your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
AC
